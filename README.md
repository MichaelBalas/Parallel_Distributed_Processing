# Parallel Distributed Processing
Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP), a computational mcthodology with origins in Associationism, is used to provide empirical information regarding neurobiological systems. PDP networks (or connectionist networks) are neurally inspired computational tools for modelling neurological and cognitive processes. A neural network is a system of many simple processing elements that usually operate in parallel whose function is determined by network structure, connection strengths, and the processing performed by the computing elements or nodes ("Neural Network Study", 1988).
